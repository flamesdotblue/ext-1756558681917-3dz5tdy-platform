          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">
            Working from a small studio in Kyoto, I draw from local clay bodies and traditional firing methods to create quiet, tactile forms. Each piece is thrown, trimmed, and glazed by hand, embracing subtle variation as a signature of the process.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">
            My practice is guided by the rhythm of tea and the seasons. I favor natural ash glazes, matte surfaces, and profiles that feel grounded in the handâ€”ceramics designed to be lived with every day.
